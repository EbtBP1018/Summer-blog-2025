                <h4>June 7th - UBC Camp and Birthday Parties</h4>
                <p>
                    In the morning I went out to UBC to go to my coding camp. We learned about Java script and there was a presentation but I had to miss it because I had other events to attend.

                <p>
                    At around 1pm I walked from camp to Uhill secondary school and helped my friend Sherisa set up her party. I also met some of her of her friends and we played soccer on the turf, had a water gun fight at the water park beside the community center and ate some food. 
                 </p> 
                <p>
                    After about an hour and a half I had to leave so I could go home and get ready for another birthday party. I was sad to leave Sherisa's party but I had already accepted my school friends invitation weeks before. 
                    For my friend Maddy's party, we went to cactus club. A bunch of my other school friends were also invited so everyone was hanging out with each other and we had so much fun, that I didn't want that day to end!

                <p>
                    We had our first game of provincials, which was qualifiers because we came second in the province for our age group so we got a BYE weekend for the PLAY IN round.

                    The reason I missed it was because I had to go to my friends birthday party at Uhill turf, on the way there I had to make a quick stop at Ken Woods for something soccer related. 
                    Then I walked down to Uhill and helped my friend set up her party. I also met some of her out of soccer friends and we played soccer, had a water gun fight and ate some food.
